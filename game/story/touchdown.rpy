    "I wake up groggily. The window beside me has the shades up, revealing the snow-blanketed town below. Everything is dark blue, illuminated by orange street lamps."

    "I rub my temples, nursing my headache."

    "Jet lag isn’t fun. My body clock tells me that it’s way past my bedtime."

    "Not complaining though, if it means I get to finally spend time with Johnny. Maintaining a long-distance relationship across different time zones has been rough."

    "Sometimes I feel that we’re drifting apart."

    "I brought it up to him. That’s why we agreed to spend the winter holidays together to rekindle the relationship."

    a "“For your safety and the safety of those around you, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened and keep the aisles clear until we are parked at the gate.”"

    "I yawn."

    a "“Please use caution when opening the overhead compartments and removing items, since articles may have shifted during flight.”"

    "The landing goes smoothly, and I pass through the customs with no trouble."

    "I collect my luggage and head towards the arrival hall. I don’t see Johnny, though."

    "“landed. whr r u?” I text him."

    "I drag my suitcase over to the seats and sit down."

    "I’m hungry. I want to grab a snack from the stores in the airport, but Johnny said he’ll bring me to Solstice Garden for dinner, so I wait."

    "“u there?” I text him again."

    "Maybe he’s getting a coffee from the café. I get up and walk through the airport, going to store after store, looking for him."

    "My stomach growls."

    "It’s okay. I imagine digging into a warm steak with a rich gravy. Soon, we’ll be having dinner together."

    "I’ve searched the airport, but I don’t see him anywhere. I pull out the phone and give him a call."

    "*Brr brr*"

    "*Brr brr*"

    "I almost hang up when he finally picks up."

    j "“What’s up?”"

    k "“Hey, babe. Where are you?”"

    j "“Huh? At home?”"

    "My heart sinks."

    k "“You’re not at the airport?”"

    j "“Why would I—oh shit.”"

    k "“You forgot?”"

    j "“I’m sure I wrote it down on my calendar app. Stupid thing didn’t remind me.”"

    k "“Can… can you come pick me up? Please?”"

    j "“Dude, that’s like, two hours away from here.”"

    k "“I can wait. I’m hungry, but I can get a snack before dinner together.”"

    j "“You haven’t had dinner? Go get something to eat, then come take a cab over.”"

    k "“What about dinner together?”"

    j "“I’m in the middle of a raid. Come over and we’ll talk.”"

    "Maybe it’s the hunger. Maybe it’s the jet lag. Maybe it’s the idea that I’m the only one who cares about this relationship. Whatever it is, I’ve had enough."

    k "“I flew all the way here to come see you, and you can’t quit your raid to see me?”"

    j "“I can’t quit the raid! My guild will kill me!”"

    k "“And you prefer to leave me stranded at the airport?”"

    j "“You’re not stranded. Just take a damn cab over!”"

    k "“So what, screw our dinner plans at Solstice Garden? Screw the car ride back together? Is this how you treat your boyfriend?”"

    j "“You’re so fucking high-maintanence. Maybe if you weren’t always going ‘we need to talk’, I wouldn’t have to ignore you so much. Get the fucking hint.”"

    k "“The heck?”"

    j "“Whatever I do is never good enough for you, huh? Fine. We’re done. Don’t come over. Hope you find someone who can babysit your whiny ass.”"

    "There’s a loud bang as I hear him throw the phone at the wall."

    j "“Sorry about that.”"

    "He’s talking to his guild mates."

    j "“Yeah, it’s my fucking boyfriend again. Well, my ex now. Dumped his ass.”"

    "He laughs."

    j "“Haha, yeah. Literally just.”"

    "I end the call. People are staring at me, but I can’t see their faces clearly through the tears in my eyes."

    "I blink the tears out of my eyes. Grabbing my luggage, I run."

    "I’m not sure where I’m going, but I eventually find a quiet corner of the airport and crumple onto the carpet in tears."
