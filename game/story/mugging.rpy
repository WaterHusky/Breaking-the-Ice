    "It’s 3 AM when I finally leave the airport, dragging my luggage back behind me."

    "My stomach feels empty, but I have no appetite to eat."

    "The thought of food makes me sick."

    k crying "Stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid!"

    "We’ve been trying to make this work for 3 years. Daily text messages. weekly video calls. We even sent each other gifts through the mail."

    k "Argh!"

    k tired "{i}*Sigh*{/i}"

    "I’ll find a motel to stay the night. I can figure this out tomorrow morning—"

    "Someone grabs my arm from behind and yanks me to face him."

    m fierce "Hand me your stuff and nobody gets hurt."

    "I’m getting mugged."

    "I’m too tired to fight. I’m too tired to flee. With my free hand, I fish my wallet out of my pocket. He snatches them away from me."

    m "Phone."

    "It’s in my other pocket. With him holding my hand tightly, it’s hard to reach over to get it out."

    m "Move faster, if you value your life."

    "I finally get the phone out of my pocket. He grabs it and shoves it into his jacket pocket."

    "I’m a sobbing mess."

    "He grabs my slingbag strap and pulls."

    m "Your bag."

    k "I n—need my passport."

    m "Don’t care."

    k "Please!"

    m "And your luggage too."

    "He snatches my luggage bag away and I almost trip on the slippery pavement."

    m "Now give me your bag or I’ll give you something to cry about."

    k "Don’t do this, please!"

    "He slides his knife under my bag strap and slices through it. I react in time and grab my bag as he tries to pull it away."

    m "Let go!"

    "He wrestles the bag away from me with repeated jerks."

    "My grip is loosening. He’s going to take my valuables, my passport, my luggage."

    "I’ll have nothing."

    t fierce "Can I help you?"

    m shocked "What the—"

    "A leopard stands behind the mugger, restraining his knife-wielding arm in a vice-like grip. He’s a head taller than the mugger with a muscular build."

    m fierce "Let go of me!"

    t "What are you doing?"

    m "None of your business!"

    t "It is very much my business. That’s my friend you’re trying to mug."

    m "I don’t give a—argh!"

    "The leopard twists the mugger’s arm. There’s a sickening crack as the mugger drops the knife. His free hand pries at the leopard’s grip, trying to free himself."

    "The leopard kicks the knife and it clatters into a nearby drain."
    
    m "Let go of me!"

    t "Return the stuff you took first."

    m "Hell no!"

    "The leopard squeezes harder."

    m "Argh! Okay, okay!"

    "He reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out my wallet, and tosses it on the floor."

    m "There! Let go!"

    "The leopard looks at me."

    t "Is that all?"

    k tired "Phone."

    t "You heard him."

    "The mugger shoots me a dirty look, but he begrudgingly complies."
    
    t "That’s it?"

    "I nod. The leopard lets go of the mugger."

    m "S—screw you!"

    "Clutching his injured arm, he runs away, disappearing around the street corner."

    "The leopard makes sure the mugger is gone before turning to me."

    t concerned "Are you alright?"
    
    "I’m too stunned to speak, but I manage a nod."

    t "You’re not from around here, are you?"

    "I shake my head."

    t "Yeah, you don’t want to be on the streets at night. Loads of shady characters around."

    "..."

    "He looks at me with a concerned expression."

    t "You sure you’re okay?"

    "I try to nod my head, but the events of the evening hit me like a train."

    "Breaking up with Johnny."

    "I’m a stranger in this town."

    "Almost losing everything on me."

    "And I’m still tired, still hungry."

    "I’m... I’m not okay."

    "I shake my head."

    k "I just... Johnny... my boyfriend... broke up... phone..."

    "The thoughts in my head are like a swarm of bees, filling my skull with a chaotic mess of incessant buzzing."

    t "Okay, okay. One step at a time. Do you have anywhere to go tonight?"

    "I shake my head."

    t "Do you want to come to my place, then? You look like you could use the rest."

    "I pause."

    "I don’t know anything about this man. I don’t know if he’s safe, I don’t know where he stays. I don’t even know his name."

    "But he did save me from the mugger, so he can’t be a bad person."

    "Even the idea of finding a motel feels overwhelming. I need to drag my luggage, book a room, and carry my stuff there."

    "I look down at the pavement. My bag is there with its torn strap, getting damp from the snow. My wallet and phone are already half-buried in the snow."

    "This is too much for me."

    t "Come. You can stay the night, get some sleep. We can figure it out tomorrow."

    "I nod."

    t smiling "Here, let me take care of your stuff."

    "He picks up my wallet and phone, and hands them to me. He holds the handle of my luggage bag and chucks my sling bag on top."

    t "Let’s go."
